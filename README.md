DailyHelper for MapleStory - intended to make your daily quests a little easier and less of a pain to do.

This project is made on cheat engine's compiler and to make use of it you will need cheat engine itself.

The program is written in LUA with some Assembler code snippets mixed in.

All of the resources required to compile the program are included in the directory (except cheat engine itself of course).
